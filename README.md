# Basic Drone Project

This project provides a unified API and documentation for comparing and abstracting the functionality of multiple educational drone SDKs, including Tello-SDK and JCoDroneEdu.

## Getting Started
- Clone this repository.
- See the markdown files for API proposals, comparisons, and setup guides.
- Use the provided documentation to understand differences and similarities between supported drones.
