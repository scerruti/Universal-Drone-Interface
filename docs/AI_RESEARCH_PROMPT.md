## AI Research Prompt: Java Drone API Standardization & Education Use

Use this prompt with Google Gemini or any web-enabled AI assistant to research the landscape for Java drone/robotics APIs, educational use, and the JSR process.

---

**Instructions for Gemini:**

1. Search the web, including the official Java Community Process (JCP) site, for any existing Java Specification Requests (JSRs) or official Java standards related to:
   - Drone APIs
   - Robotics APIs
   - Educational hardware control in Java

2. Search for evidence of educational use of drones with Java, including:
   - University course materials or syllabi
   - Academic publications
   - Forum discussions (e.g., Stack Overflow, Reddit, robotics/education forums)
   - Social media posts (e.g., Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Facebook groups) mentioning Java and drones in education

3. Summarize your findings, providing links to relevant resources and noting any major projects, standards, or communities.

4. Based on your research, make a recommendation about whether pursuing a new JSR for a universal drone interface in Java is warranted, considering:
   - Existing standards or lack thereof
   - Community and educational interest
   - Technical feasibility and potential impact

5. Suggest any additional steps or considerations for someone interested in standardizing a Java drone API for education, such as:
   - Are there any major open-source or commercial Java drone libraries already widely used in education?
   - What are the main technical challenges or gaps in current Java drone/robotics APIs?
   - Are there active communities or working groups (outside the JCP) focused on this topic?
   - What is the process and typical timeline for proposing and advancing a JSR?
   - Are there similar standards efforts in other languages (e.g., Python, C++) that could inform the Java effort?
